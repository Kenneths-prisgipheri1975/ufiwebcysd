OMG, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Marching Powder, and I can’t even begin to process everything. Like, what even was that?? You know when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a   thinking it's gonna be kinda intriguing but also low-key same old, and then it just sucker punches you with all kinds of craziness? That’s where I’m at. Just trying to wrap my head around it all.

I seriously cannot believe Thomas and his whole “entrepreneurial” spirit, lol. Like, bro, you're in prison, maybe chill a little on the business ventures. But I mean, at the same time, respect? You gotta admire the hustle. This dude turned a literal jail into a damn tourist attraction — only in Bolivia, right?

> So, anyway, that bit where he was guiding tourists around like it was some kind of bizarre Airbnb experience. I mean, talk about service with a shiv. 😏 But like, also, how is this even allowed?!? My brain is stuck between “this is sooo wrong” and “okay, tell me more!” You know what I mean? Can’t decide if it was irresponsible or genius... maybe a bit of both.

And then the whole deal with those jail rules. Like, hello?? You don’t have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   to agree it’s nuts. Everyone trying to survive in their way, but also like, what kind of system just lets you BYOB your way through a sentence? It’s like a 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦-for-all, and I guess you just adapt or...yeah. The coke factories right there in the prison?? Seriously, what even... I'm baffled.

So yes, I’m now more exhausted than ever. This   made me want a vacation from the craziness of someone else's everyday life. I never expected to feel like I've gone and mapped out escape routes and business plans for my imaginary inmate self in one evening, lol. Gonna need a whole other   just to unwind from this one. 🤣

int[] numbers = {42, 0, 12, 4, 77}; // I don't even know why I typed this, maybe Marching Powder is getting to me, lol.

But yeah, overall, I’m still processing. Wild ride for sure. Time for tea and maybe a good, predictable romcom to balance things out. Talk later! 🍵📺💤
